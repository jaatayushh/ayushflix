## Architectural Overview

The application is structured into modular subprojects separating platform abstraction, runtime transcompilation, and UI presentation:

| Module | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`:desktop-app`** | Compose Multiplatform presentation layer, Amoled dark theme, local stream proxy, and native desktop window controls. |
| **`:plugin-runtime`** | Transcompilation engine. Converts Dalvik DEX bytecode into JVM bytecode via Dex2jar, applies ASM bytecode instrumentation, and enforces sandbox security policies. |
| **`:player-abstraction`** | JNA bindings to the native `libmpv` C-core for hardware-accelerated video decoding. |
| **`:android-stubs`** | Stubs for Android platform APIs (`Context`, `SharedPreferences`, `Build`, `DisplayMetrics`) allowing Android extension bytecode to run on the JVM. |
| **`:common`** | SQLite persistence layer powered by **SQLDelight** for local history, preferences, and state management. |
| **`:library`** | Base CloudStream contracts and core provider interfaces. |

## Developer Setup & Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* **Operating System:** Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
* **Web Runtime:** **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime** (pre-installed by default on Windows 11 and modern Windows 10; [Evergreen Bootstrapper](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) available if omitted on custom OS builds). Note: Google Chrome is not used.
* **Java Development Kit:** **JDK 21** or higher (e.g. [Eclipse Adoptium Temurin 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21))
* **Git:** Installed and available in PATH

---

### Step 1: Clone With Submodules
This repository relies on internal submodules. You **must** clone recursively:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/errorcode26/CS3-desktop-client-unofficial.git
cd CS3-desktop-client-unofficial
```

*(If you already cloned without `--recursive`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` inside the repository).*

---

### Step 2: Native Binaries Setup (MPV)
The video player requires the 64-bit native `libmpv-2.dll` placed in `desktop-app/appResources/windows/mpv/`.

Because `libmpv-2.dll` (~112 MB) exceeds GitHub's 100 MB single-file repository limit, it is not bundled directly in git.

| Binary | Distribution | Tracked in Git? | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **`libmpv-2.dll`** (~112 MB) | Downloaded manually | No | Native MPV media playback core |
| **`player_bridge.dll`** (~180 KB) | Pre-bundled | Yes | Win32 Airspace HWND compositor & low-latency fast-path |
| **`WebView2Loader.dll`** (~160 KB) | Pre-bundled | Yes | Microsoft WebView2 runtime dynamic loader |

**How to get `libmpv-2.dll`:**
1. Download the `mpv-dev-x86_64-*.7z` development package from [shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake releases](https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake/releases) (such as pinned build [20260610](https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake/releases/tag/20260610)).
2. Extract `libmpv-2.dll` from the downloaded archive.
3. Place `libmpv-2.dll` into:

```text
desktop-app/
└── appResources/
    └── windows/
        ├── mpv/
        │   ├── libmpv-2.dll          <-- Place extracted DLL here
        │   └── portable_config/
        │       └── mpv.conf
        └── jni/
            ├── player_bridge.dll     <-- Pre-bundled in repository
            └── WebView2Loader.dll    <-- Pre-bundled in repository
```

---

### Step 3: Run & Build

Use the interactive launcher script:

```bat
.\launch.bat
```

The launcher provides quick shortcuts:
* `.\launch.bat dev` — Start the client with Live LogCat (F12) enabled.
* `.\launch.bat release` — Launch the compiled standalone executable.
* `.\launch.bat build` — Compile the standalone distribution EXE via Gradle.
* `.\launch.bat test` — Run all module test suites and compile checks.

Alternatively, execute tasks directly via Gradle:
```bat
# Run in dev mode
.\gradlew.bat :desktop-app:run --args="--dev"

# Compile standalone distributable
.\gradlew.bat :desktop-app:createDistributable
```

## Native Bridge & Player Architecture

### The Win32 Airspace & Fast-Path Architecture
Directly overlaying Java Swing / Compose Multiplatform components onto a native video window handle (`HWND`) causes severe visual occlusion and flicker (the Win32 "Airspace problem"). Furthermore, routing high-frequency seekbar scrubs through JVM garbage collection and JNI layers introduces 10–50ms latency delays that cause scrubber rubber-banding.

CloudStream Desktop resolves this through a hybrid native architecture in `desktop-app/src/main/cpp/player_bridge.cpp`:
1. **HWND Composition:** A unified native Win32 container (`g_containerHwnd`) hosts MPV's render context as the base layer, with a transparent Microsoft WebView2 Chromium instance layered directly on top.
2. **C++ Native Fast-Path:** Timeline scrubbing, volume changes, and state events are intercepted and processed directly inside C++ in sub-millisecond time (`g_mpv_command_string`), completely bypassing JVM overhead.
3. **High-Frequency Polling:** A native timer polls MPV playback positions (`time-pos`, `bufferPos`) and pushes updates via `PostWebMessageAsJson` without allocating JVM objects.
4. **Cloudflare CDP Resolution:** WebView2 is also leveraged headlessly by `CloudflareKiller.kt` via Chrome DevTools Protocol to solve Cloudflare Turnstile / anti-bot challenges that Android extensions expect an Android OS WebView to handle.

### Optional: Recompiling the Native C++ Bridge
Developers only need a C++ compiler if modifying `desktop-app/src/main/cpp/player_bridge.cpp`. The pre-compiled DLLs are already tracked in git.

To recompile:
* **MinGW-w64 (GCC):** Ensure `g++` and `JAVA_HOME` are set, then execute:
  ```powershell
  cd desktop-app\src\main\cpp
  .\build_jni.ps1
  ```
  *(Statically links `libstdc++` and `libwinpthread` to eliminate external runtime dependencies).*
* **CMake (MSVC / CLion):** A standard `CMakeLists.txt` is provided in `desktop-app/src/main/cpp/` linking the self-contained WebView2 headers and libraries in `webview2/`.
